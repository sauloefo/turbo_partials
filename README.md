# Turbo Partials


The major goal of Turbo Partials (temporary name) is to enable users to edit fields in place without having to navigate to a different page and then click on some button to actually save the changes in the database.


At the moment, the changes of a field are saved when the user hits enter and the changes are discarded when the user hits escape e leave the field without hitting enter.
